D2N098,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Jose James, born on 9/29/1957, presented with a five-month history of constant pain in his left shoulder and elbow. The pain began after a fall on icy stairs where he landed on his left side. The pain is exacerbated by lifting weights, and he has been unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds. He has stopped gym activities due to the pain but continues to walk daily. He has tried icing the area, but it has provided minimal relief. There are no symptoms of numbness or tingling.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient reported pain when pressure was applied to the left shoulder and elbow. There was no warmth, erythema, or deformity observed. Positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's test were noted. Normal proximal and distal upper extremity strength was observed, with intact median radial ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees. 

RESULTS:
The physical examination and patient's history suggest a diagnosis of impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. The wrist pain is likely referred from the shoulder issue.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient was diagnosed with impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. The initial treatment plan includes physical therapy two days per week, along with home exercises. If there is no improvement, a cortisone injection will be considered. The patient was advised to continue icing the shoulder and rest as much as possible.

D2N099,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Randy Gutierrez, a baby born on 8/10/2020, has been feeling unwell since the previous night. Symptoms include a runny nose, clear mucus, non-barky cough, ear pulling, and nose rubbing. He also had a low-grade fever of 100.3°F. His appetite has been inconsistent, and he has been irritable and having difficulty sleeping. He has been exposed to his older sister who has been sick and a nephew with a sinus infection. The patient has been given saline mist, Tylenol, baby Vick's, and a humidifier has been used. The patient also has worsening cradle cap.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient's breathing was normal, and his ears appeared to be okay. The patient was irritable but energetic.

RESULTS:
The patient's symptoms and physical exam suggest a viral infection, possibly the beginning of a sinus infection. The cradle cap has worsened.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient does not require antibiotics at this time. The plan is to continue with fluids, rest, and monitor for a barky cough. If a barky cough develops, the patient should be given a half teaspoon of his sister's medicine. The patient's caregiver was also given the same medicine as a precaution. The patient can use Zarbee's for the stuffy nose, but honey should be avoided due to the risk of botulism. For the cradle cap, a dandruff shampoo like Head & Shoulders, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral AD should be used twice a week, along with a soft brush and baby oil. The patient should return for a follow-up in one week."
D2N100,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Kayla Ward, a 7th-grade student, has been experiencing facial acne for approximately two years. The acne is present most days and is somewhat managed with regular washing and the use of Persa-Gel. There are no associated symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or pain. The acne does not seem to flare with her menstrual cycle, which has been regular for about two years. The most significant flare-up occurred when she started school sports in the fall. 

PHYSICAL EXAM:
A full examination was performed, excluding under the underwear and bra. Kayla has multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities, scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, central cheeks, and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of the examination is normal.

RESULTS:
The examination revealed mild to moderate acne, mostly comodonal with a small inflammatory component. Kayla also has multiple benign moles on her arms, legs, back, and abdomen, all of which appear normal with no worrisome features.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The plan is to start Kayla on a topical therapy. Every morning, she will wash her face with a mild cleanser, then use a noncomedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 or higher. In the evening, she will wash her face with the same cleanser, allow it to dry, then apply Adapalene 0.1% cream in a thin layer to the areas where she generally gets acne. She will start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night. If the Adapalene is not covered by insurance or is very expensive, she can try a different gel over the counter. She will follow this with Clean and Clear Persa-Gel in a thin layer, then a noncomedogenic moisturizer. As the topical retinoid may cause some sensitivity, she will need to wear sunscreen when outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation. Progress will be assessed in six months."
D2N101,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Julia Jones, a 25-year-old female, presented for a breast reduction consultation. She has been considering this procedure for approximately six to seven years. She has been experiencing back, neck, and shoulder pain, which she attributes to her large breasts. She has been seeing a chiropractor for a few years due to this pain. She also experiences occasional numbness and tingling in her hands and nipple pain. She has not had any children but plans to in the future. She has a family history of breast cancer, with her mother diagnosed at age 40. She has lost 10 pounds recently and plans to lose 20 more. She occasionally drinks wine and is currently studying psychology.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient has asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally. There is no nipple retraction or discharge. No breast tenderness, masses, or axillary lymphadenopathy were palpable. The patient's bra size is approximately a G cup, but she mostly wears a 34 E sports bra for comfort. 

RESULTS:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest symptomatic macromastia. The patient's minimum required resection, based on a BSA of 2.65, with the Schnur scale is 1,792 grams.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. The procedure will involve removing tissue from the breasts, lifting them, and elevating the nipple position to help alleviate her symptoms. The surgery will take about three hours, and the patient will be kept overnight for monitoring. Post-surgery, the patient will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks. The patient is aware that there is a 30% chance she may not be able to breastfeed after the procedure. The patient is ready to proceed with the surgery as soon as her insurance is switched over. The office will work with her to set a surgery date once the new insurance provider approves the procedure."
D2N102,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Kelly Wood, born on February 15th, 1979, is an established patient who presented for a renal ultrasound due to hematuria. She reported passing two small stones last week and has had episodes of bright red urine for the past six weeks. She also experienced frequent urination and severe pain last week. However, she reported feeling better after passing the stones.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient reported no current flank pain or tenderness in the lower back. She is only taking Alavert 10 milligrams a day and has no drug allergies. The physical examination revealed no abnormalities.

RESULTS:
The urine dipstick was negative for leukocytes, nitrates, protein, ketone, bilirubin, and glucose. The color was yellow and clear, with urobilinogen 0.2, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.020. There was a trace amount of blood in the urine. The renal ultrasound showed a right kidney measuring 10 cm in length by 5 cm wide with no stones, masses, or hydronephrosis. The left kidney measured 10.8 cm in length and 5 cm wide with a 6 mm non-obstructing left renal stone. The pre-void volume was 533 milliliters and post-void volume was 0 milliliters.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The primary diagnosis is hematuria and the secondary diagnosis is chronic urolithiasis. The blood in the urine was attributed to the kidney stones. The patient was advised to increase her water intake, avoid sugary drinks, and limit her consumption of foods rich in sodium, oxalate, and animal protein. No surgical intervention is recommended at this time due to the non-obstructing nature of the remaining kidney stone. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up next year unless she experiences any issues like bleeding or pain. In case of severe pain or bright red blood in the urine, she is advised to go to the emergency room."
D2N103,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Melissa Sanchez, born on 9/23/1962, had a mitral valve repair on 8/3/2020. She has a history of mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, asthma, and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease. Her ECG taken on 12/26/2020 revealed atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response and T-wave inversion anteriorly. She reports occasional chest pains and shallow breathing, which she manages by slowing down her activities. These episodes last a few minutes and occur a couple of times a month.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient's head and neck showed no JVD. Her lungs had reduced breath, but auscultation and percussion were clear. Her heart rhythm was irregularly irregular, indicative of her atrial fibrillation. S1 was slightly accentuated, with no S3. There was no pain on abdominal palpation, and trace peripheral edema was noted on her extremities.

RESULTS:
The ECG showed atrial fibrillation, which is being well controlled with medication. The patient is currently on Coumadin (4mg), Lasix (4mg), and Atenolol (50mg) daily. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Ms. Sanchez is recovering well from her mitral valve repair surgery. Her heart valves are functioning well, and her atrial fibrillation is under control with medication. She is advised to continue with her current medications and to stay active within her comfort level. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for six to nine months from now."
D2N104,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Patient Judy Gomez, born on 5/7/1961, has been under ongoing management for psoriatic arthritis. She has been on a decreasing dose of prednisone, currently at one dose, which she occasionally increases to two doses when experiencing increased pain in her feet. She also takes methotrexate for joint pain, which she temporarily discontinued during her COVID-19 vaccination due to concerns about interference with the vaccine's efficacy. This led to a significant increase in pain until she resumed the medication. She has also been experiencing unexplained bruising.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient reported pain in her joints, particularly in her feet. She demonstrated good range of motion when asked to flex her toes. Ridges were observed in her nails, a symptom of her psoriasis.

RESULTS:
The patient's pain seems to be well-managed with her current medication regimen, although she did report increased pain when she temporarily discontinued methotrexate. The unexplained bruising she has been experiencing is likely a side effect of the prednisone.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The plan is to discontinue the prednisone and continue with the methotrexate. The patient will be monitored for any changes in her bruising and joint pain. She will also need to schedule an appointment for blood work due to the high-risk nature of her medication. The patient will return for a follow-up visit in three months."
D2N105,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Diana Scott, a 100-year-old female, presented with a new heart murmur as reported by her primary care physician. She has been experiencing severe leg pain for the past month and has been taking pain medication for it. She also reports shortness of breath when walking too fast or too long, or when drinking a whole glass of water without stopping. She has noticed a 70-80% increase in these symptoms over the past six months. She also experiences occasional dizziness for which she takes medication. She has noticed swelling in her ankles for the past six months and has lost about 10 pounds over the past year. She also reports feeling overly tired due to her medication.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient is an elderly woman in no acute distress. Cardiovascular examination revealed a normal S1 and S2 with a normal rate and regular rhythm. There is a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. Her gait is normal for her age.

RESULTS:
The patient's EKG showed sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs and an anterior septum infarct pattern. She has been referred for an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient's heart murmur is likely representative of aortic stenosis. Her symptoms could be due to severe aortic stenosis, but her S2 is relatively preserved, which is more consistent with moderate aortic stenosis. She will undergo an echocardiogram to confirm this diagnosis. Depending on the results, further evaluation for ischemia or a heart monitor to assess the burden of PVCs may be considered. Her bilateral leg pain will be evaluated following the echocardiogram. Her statin medication may be reconsidered due to her leg pain. Her lightheadedness and dizziness could be related to the aortic stenosis or PVCs. She will follow up in three to four weeks to discuss the results and next steps."
D2N106,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Charles, has been experiencing shortness of breath and watery eyes. He has been using an inhaler prescribed by an urgent care center when he feels the symptoms coming on. He has noticed these symptoms in various situations, including at home, when his cat is not around, and outside. He has no history of allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vital signs are normal, with no signs of distress. No rash or angioedema was observed. There was faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields. 

RESULTS:
A chest X-ray and pulmonary function test were performed, both of which came back normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient has been diagnosed with allergic asthma. He is advised to continue using the albuterol inhaler as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms. A new medication, Singulair 10mg, will be prescribed to help decrease the occurrences of asthma. Allergy testing will be conducted, starting with skin testing, to identify potential triggers. If the triggers cannot be identified, further testing will be done on the patient's blood and immunotherapy will be considered. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment next week to conduct the skin testing."
D2N107,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Bryan, presented with back pain and pins and needles in his right foot. The symptoms started after he was raking leaves in his yard. He had a similar episode of back pain three years ago, which resolved after a day. The patient tried ice and Advil for the pain, but it did not help. The pain seems to lessen when he sits and after a hot shower. The patient's partner reported that the pain also occurs when the patient stands up.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient experienced pain when bending over and when the doctor palpated around the L5 area of his back. The patient's dorsiflexion was normal, and pulses were equal in all extremities. The patient reported tingling in his right leg.

RESULTS:
The patient had an X-ray of his lower back, which appeared normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The doctor assessed that the patient likely sprained his lower back. The treatment plan includes rest, a prescription for Meloxicam, and physical therapy to help the patient become more active and learn stretches and exercises. If the patient's condition does not improve, the doctor plans to consider further investigation, potentially with an MRI. The patient's partner expressed concern and a desire for an immediate MRI, but the doctor suggested waiting two weeks to see if the condition improves with the initial treatment plan."
D2N108,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Gregory, has been suffering from a non-healing foot ulcer for about two months. The ulcer has recently become red and started draining. The patient believes he may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach. He was prescribed antibiotics by his primary care physician but has not yet picked them up from the pharmacy. The patient also has diabetes, which is not well-controlled, with a last reported A1C of around 10.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient's vital signs were normal with no fever. The foot exam revealed a 1x2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, proximal to the fifth MTP joint. There was redness, drainage, and edema around the wound, but no necrosis, odor, or bony exposure. The patient reported increased pressure but no distinct pain when the wound was touched.

RESULTS:
An X-ray of the patient's right foot showed no evidence of osteomyelitis, indicating that the infection is limited to the skin.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient has a diabetic foot ulcer. An Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) will be ordered to determine the blood supply in the foot and assess the potential for healing the ulcer. A debridement will be performed to remove dead tissue. The patient will be prescribed Clindamycin (400mg, twice a day for seven days) to treat the infection. A surgical shoe will be provided to reduce pressure on the foot and aid in healing. The patient will be seen again in two weeks for a follow-up and possible additional debridement. The patient is advised to contact the office if any issues arise in the meantime, and to seek urgent care or visit the ER if he experiences a fever or if the wound turns black."
D2N109,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Stephanie Morales, a 36-year-old female, presented with complaints of left ankle pain following a fall on ice two days ago. She reported that her ankle twisted underneath her, causing significant pain and swelling. She has been managing the pain with ibuprofen, ice, and elevation. The patient also has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure, which she reports have been stable with medication and diet.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient's neck, lungs, and heart were normal. She had a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from previous exams. Her abdomen was normal. Examination of the left ankle revealed tenderness over the lateral malleolus and the fifth metatarsal, with some swelling and redness. There was pain with valgus stressing of the ankle. Sensation and pulses were normal.

RESULTS:
The patient's blood pressure was 120/70. Her last recorded hemoglobin A1C was 6.8. An X-ray of the ankle was ordered due to the tenderness over the fifth metatarsal and concerns of a possible fracture.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The initial diagnosis is an ankle sprain, but a fracture has not been ruled out pending X-ray results. The patient was given an air splint and crutches, advised to avoid weight-bearing, and prescribed Naprosyn 500mg twice a day for pain control. If the X-ray shows a fracture, the patient will be referred to orthopedics. If no fracture is found, the patient will be advised to do partial weight-bearing and continue with the current treatment plan. 

For her diabetes, the patient is advised to keep her upcoming eye appointment, continue with Metformin, and have another hemoglobin A1C test. For her high blood pressure, a refill of Norvasc was ordered. The patient is advised to continue monitoring her blood pressure and contact the office if there are any changes."
D2N110,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Wayne, has been suffering from a non-healing wound on his right foot for about two to three weeks. The wound was initially a blister caused by a new pair of shoes that were too tight, which the patient didn't initially notice due to neuropathy. The patient has been applying band-aids to the wound and has completed a course of antibiotics prescribed by his primary care physician, but the wound has not improved. The patient has not experienced any other symptoms such as fever, chills, or drainage from the wound. The patient also has a history of diabetes, with his last Hgb A1C being a little over eight.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 98.1, heart rate of 72, respirations of 16, and blood pressure of 110/65. The foot exam revealed a 1x2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, just proximal to the right fifth MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue, no surrounding erythema or cellulitis, no evidence of fluid collection, necrosis, or odor, and no bony exposure. Vascular exam showed palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses, no palpable DP or PT pulses, but Doppler signs are present.

RESULTS:
The patient's right foot X-ray showed no evidence of osteomyelitis, indicating no bone infection.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient has a diabetic foot ulcer. An ankle brachial index (ABI) will be ordered to determine the blood supply to the foot. A debridement will be performed in the office to remove dead tissue. A collagenase ointment will be prescribed to be applied to the wound once daily, covered with a dry sterile dressing, until the wound shrinks and pink tissue is present. The patient is advised to wear a surgical shoe to relieve pressure on the area. No further antibiotics are needed at this time. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks, with a possible referral to a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates suboptimal blood supply for wound healing. The patient's diabetes needs to be better controlled for the wound to heal, so a diabetic consult may be arranged to discuss potential dietary modifications to lower the patient's Hgb A1C."
D2N111,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, William, presented with a week-old injury to his right knee, which he sustained while at a trampoline park. He reported hearing a snap and experiencing instant pain at the time of the incident. The pain is located on the outside of the knee. He has been managing the pain with Tylenol, which has not been very effective. He also elevated the knee for relief. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, and is on 20mg of Lisinopril and 500mg of Metformin respectively. He has been inconsistent with his exercise and diet regimen.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient's blood pressure was found to be high. His heart rate and rhythm were regular, and no murmurs were detected. His lungs sounded clear bilaterally. His right knee showed signs of bruising and swelling on the outside, but no effusion was noted. He was able to bend and straighten his knee, albeit with some pain. He was also able to bear weight, but walked with a limp.

RESULTS:
An X-ray of the right knee showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient's right knee pain is likely due to a lateral ligament strain. He will be prescribed 15mg of Meloxicam daily for pain and swelling, and referred to physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area and prevent further injury. If the pain persists, further imaging may be required. His hypertension will continue to be managed with 20mg of Lisinopril, and an echo will be ordered to monitor his condition. His diabetes will be managed with 500mg of Metformin, and an A1C and lipid panel will be ordered to get a better understanding of his long-term blood sugar levels and make any necessary adjustments to his medication."
D2N112,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Matthew, has been experiencing chronic back pain for a long time, which has worsened significantly over the past month. The pain is located in his lower back and radiates down his left leg, described as an ""electrical toothache"". The pain is exacerbated by standing, walking, coughing, and sneezing, and is somewhat relieved by lying down. The patient also reports weakness in his back and legs. The pain is rated as 6 out of 10 at the time of the visit, but can reach up to 13 out of 10 during severe episodes. The patient has a history of a fall from a roof 30 years ago, which may have resulted in a fracture.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient's vitals are normal. There are no bony abnormalities, redness, or bruising present on the back. Pain is elicited upon palpation at the L4 vertebrae. The patient experiences pain with flexion and extension of the back. Strength in the left leg is 4 out of 5, and 5 out of 5 in the right leg. Reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory functions are intact in both lower extremities.

RESULTS:
The MRI shows a disk herniation at the level of L4-L5 vertebrae, associated with nerve root impingement.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient is diagnosed with acute disk herniation at L4-L5 with nerve root impingement, causing pain in the lower back and left leg. The patient has tried NSAIDs and physical therapy (PT) in the past without relief. The treatment plan includes an epidural steroid injection to reduce inflammation at the site, followed by a referral back to PT to strengthen the area. The patient is to follow up in a month. The patient agrees to this treatment plan."
D2N113,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Jacqueline, has recently been diagnosed with Hepatitis C by her primary care physician. She has a history of IV drug use and heavy alcohol consumption, although she has been clean for over 15 years and has significantly reduced her alcohol intake. She currently smokes one to two cigarettes a day, down from a pack and a half a day. She reports feeling unusually tired at the end of the day, despite getting enough sleep. She has a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and depression.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient appears in no distress and shows no signs of jaundice. Her heart rate and rhythm are regular, with a 2/6 systolic murmur that has not changed from last year. Her lungs are clear with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Her abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly. There is no gait disturbance or edema observed.

RESULTS:
The patient's HCV antibody test was positive. Her liver panel showed an elevated AST at 39, but her ALT, albumin, and total bilirubin were all within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The initial labs are consistent with Hepatitis C, likely contracted years ago. The next step is to confirm the diagnosis with additional blood work, including checking the Hep C RNA and HCV genotype. The severity of the liver disease will be determined by checking for fibrosis of the liver via a special ultrasound. This information will guide the treatment plan. The patient's family should also be screened for Hepatitis C. The patient will be seen again in three weeks."
D2N114,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a long-time sufferer of headaches, which have recently increased in frequency and severity. The headaches are primarily on the right side and often feel like a pulsing sensation behind the eye. The patient has also reported experiencing a ringing in the ears for a few months and occasional blurred vision. The headaches seem to worsen with physical activity, particularly jogging.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient's vitals, including blood pressure, were normal. The heart exam showed normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The funduscopic exam showed papilledema, indicating some swelling behind the eye. The neurological exam showed that cranial nerves one through twelve were intact, including a normal cranial reflex. The patient's gait was normal during the musculoskeletal exam.

RESULTS:
The physical exam results, combined with the patient's reported symptoms, suggest a possible diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This condition is characterized by increased pressure in the brain without a known cause and can lead to permanent changes in vision if not addressed.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The plan is to conduct further tests to confirm the diagnosis. An MRI will be scheduled to check for any other conditions that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. A spinal tap will also be performed to evaluate the pressure in the brain and potentially alleviate some of the pressure by removing some fluid. The patient will also be referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. If the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is confirmed, the treatment plan may include medication to decrease the pressure in the brain, as well as lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss."
D2N115,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Jack, was involved in a car accident a week ago where he experienced a sudden forward movement of his neck. Since then, he has been experiencing pain in the back of his neck, rating it as a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. The pain is not constant but is triggered by movement of the head. The patient has tried ibuprofen which provided minimal relief. He also reported having a few headaches early on after the accident. The patient has a history of playing football but did not have any neck issues from it. He did not visit the emergency room after the accident.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient showed positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck. He also experienced pain with neck flexion, extension, and rotation. There was no pain when pressure was applied to the back or shoulders. The patient was unable to touch his ear to his shoulders due to pain.

RESULTS:
The patient's X-ray results showed no signs of fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient is diagnosed with neck strain, likely a result of whiplash from the car accident. The treatment plan includes anti-inflammatories (Motrin 600mg every 6-8 hours) and a muscle relaxant (Flexeril 10mg every 12 hours as needed). The patient is advised to avoid straining his neck and to move conservatively. An MRI is ordered to rule out a concussion or any nerve impingement. Depending on the MRI results, a referral to physical rehab or a chiropractor may be considered."
D2N116,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Bobby, presented with persistent right shoulder pain that started a few weeks ago while doing various projects in his backyard. He has a history of minor issues with the same shoulder due to an injury sustained while playing baseball in his youth. The pain is more on the outside of the shoulder and is more tender when he raises his arm. The pain is not constant but is felt whenever he moves his arm and slightly at night due to sleeping on that side. He has been managing the pain with Advil and icing. He also reported soreness in his feet and ankles from the same yard work.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vitals were normal with no fever. The patient had limited active and passive range of motion in his right shoulder. There was tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus but no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Hand grip was good. Neurovascular exam of the right arm showed capillary refill less than three seconds and intact sensation to touch.

RESULTS:
The shoulder x-ray showed no fracture.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient's symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. An MRI was ordered to further investigate the issue due to the patient's previous shoulder problems. The patient was referred to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks. He was advised to continue taking Tylenol and if symptoms do not improve, a steroid injection for the shoulder will be considered. For the soreness in his feet and ankles, the patient was advised to soak his feet in Epsom salts to help relax the muscles and alleviate the soreness."

A referral to a urologist, specifically Dr. Harris, will be made due to her recurrent kidney stones. Her hypertension seems to be well-managed with her current medication, Norvasc, and no changes will be made at this time. A consult to nutrition will be made to help her improve her diet. Her diabetes is being managed with Metformin, and she is advised to start taking her blood sugars before every meal. For her insomnia, she is advised to take 10mg of melatonin as needed and to practice proper sleep hygiene. The patient will return for a follow-up visit in three months."
D2N119,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Betty, has been suffering from asthma for the past six months. She experiences frequent coughing and wheezing, which are triggered by colds and exposure to cats. Her symptoms occur monthly or bi-monthly, often leading to visits to urgent care or her primary care doctor. She uses an albuterol inhaler (Ventolin) almost daily and occasionally at night. She has been hospitalized once due to her asthma when she was eight years old. Her last exacerbation was a month ago. She does not smoke or vape and tries to avoid areas with airborne particulates, such as bars with smokers.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Betty's vitals are stable with a blood pressure of 128/82, respiratory rate of 16, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Her heart is regular with no ectopic beats, rubs, murmurs, or gallops. Her lung exam revealed diminished lung sounds throughout with occasional slight expiratory wheezes bilaterally. Her neck is supple with a midline trachea and no lymphadenopathy. Her hands show strong bilateral pulses, no clubbing, and brisk capillary refill.

RESULTS:
The results of Betty's pulmonary function test are consistent with a diagnosis of asthma.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Betty's symptoms are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma. The plan is to maintain consistency with her inhaled steroid inhaler to reduce daily symptoms and the need for her albuterol inhaler. In case of an acute exacerbation, she should continue to use her albuterol inhaler, taking 1-2 puffs and waiting to see how her breathing is before taking an additional 1-2 puffs. An asthma action plan will be put together to manage her symptoms. She will be seen again in 30 days or sooner if her symptoms worsen. She will also be started on Flovent 110 micrograms, one puff twice per day."
D2N120,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Larry, has been experiencing chronic back pain for a couple of years. The pain started after moving furniture one weekend. The pain is described as a sharp, stabbing sensation that radiates down to his right leg and sometimes to his big toe. He also experiences numbness and tingling in his right leg and foot. The pain is worse when sitting and he finds it difficult to get comfortable. He has tried physical therapy and strong pain medications in the past with temporary relief. He has gained weight due to reduced activity caused by the back pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient's vitals are overall good. On musculoskeletal back exam, there is midline tenderness at L4 L5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain is present with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive. On neurological examination, there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at L4 dermatome. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.

RESULTS:
MRI results show disk herniation with nerve impingement.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient's symptoms, physical exam, and MRI results are consistent with an L4 L5 herniated disk with radiculopathy. The plan is to administer a spinal injection with a corticosteroid into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy to help localize to the exact area of pain. This should help reduce the inflammation causing the pain. The patient will be monitored to see how he responds to the injection. The frequency of injections will be determined based on the patient's response, but typically not more than four times a year. The patient agreed to start the first injection today."

The patient will be referred to a gastroenterologist for further examination and possible dilation. The patient will also be started on Prilosec 20mg once a day to manage potential reflux. He is advised to chew his food thoroughly, especially hard foods, and to seek emergency care if food gets stuck. 

For his diabetes, the doctor will order another hemoglobin A1C and additional blood work to check kidney function. The patient will also be referred to ophthalmology for an eye exam to check for any retinopathy. He is to continue his current regimen of Metformin 500mg twice a day and return for a follow-up in a month.

For his high blood pressure, the patient is to continue with Norvasc and monitor his blood pressure at home. He is also given a refill for Norvasc."
D2N124,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Jerry, a 45-year-old male, presented with an ankle injury sustained while playing basketball with his son. He reported landing awkwardly, rolling and twisting his ankle. He has been experiencing pain, particularly on the outside of the ankle, which is also bruised and swollen. He has been having trouble walking and reports instability in the ankle.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient's ankle was swollen, particularly on the outside. There was exquisite tenderness laterally and some tenderness over the medial deltoid region. The skin was intact with brisk capillary refill and no malalignment. The patient reported pain and instability when attempting to stand or walk.

RESULTS:
An X-ray of the patient's right ankle revealed a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level. There was no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient was diagnosed with a lateral malleolar fracture. Given the location and displacement of the fracture, surgical intervention was recommended, which would involve the placement of a plate and screws. The patient was informed that he would likely be unable to participate in physical activities for approximately three months. He was prescribed meloxicam to manage the swelling and advised to ice and elevate the ankle regularly. The patient was also provided with crutches to aid mobility."
D2N125,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Mr. Edwards, a 54-year-old male, presented with a complaint of stabbing, shooting pain in the right cheekbone area of his face. The pain has been present for approximately two to three months and is sometimes accompanied by a sensation of heat. The pain is triggered by certain temperatures and wind. The patient has tried ibuprofen, Motrin, and topical treatments like Tiger Balm, but these have not provided relief. The episodes of pain can last from a few minutes to an hour. The patient has no history of multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, or migraines, but does experience occasional headaches.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient's facial movements were symmetric, and he was able to follow the doctor's finger in both directions. His hearing was normal on both sides. However, he reported a slight numbness on the right side of his face when touched with a cotton tape and a dull sensation when poked with a needle, compared to a sharp sensation on the left side.

RESULTS:
The MRI results showed a small blood vessel abutting and possibly pinching the trigeminal nerve, suggesting a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The initial treatment plan is to start the patient on Tegretol, a medication that reduces the excitability of the nerve. The patient was informed about potential side effects, including memory loss, tingling, imbalance, and possible skin reactions. Genetic testing may be conducted to ensure the medication is safe for the patient. If the medication does not provide relief, surgical options may be considered. The patient will return for a follow-up appointment in one month."
D2N126,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Michelle, is a generally healthy, active individual who recently injured her right knee while skiing. She reported a popping sensation in her knee during the fall and has been experiencing pain and instability since. She was unable to bear weight on the knee and had to be taken down the slope by ski patrol. The pain is primarily on the outside of the knee and she has difficulty bending and straightening it. There is no numbness or tingling in her toes.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient's heart and lungs were normal. The right knee showed signs of edema and effusion. There was pain upon palpation of the right lateral knee, decreased flexion and extension, and a positive Lachman sign. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were palpable, and there was no leg edema in the ankle.

RESULTS:
An X-ray of the right knee did not show any bony abnormality. However, the physical exam findings suggest a possible rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The doctor suspects an ACL rupture and plans to order an MRI of the knee to confirm this diagnosis and to check for any other potential damage. The patient is currently managing the pain with ibuprofen and has been advised to continue this regimen. The doctor also plans to provide a knee brace for additional support. The patient will be seen again after the MRI results are available to discuss further treatment options, which may include grafting if the ACL is indeed torn."
D2N127,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Brandon, has been involved in multiple car accidents, the most recent one being in February of the current year. He has been experiencing severe neck pain since then, rating it as a 12 on a scale of 1 to 10. He has previously undergone therapy and surgery due to the accidents. He has been prescribed Fentanyl for the pain but has not received a prescription for several weeks. He experiences sharp, incapacitating pain that prevents him from working. He also reports headaches, occasional dizziness, numbness in his left arm and right leg, and body spasms.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Upon examination, the patient exhibits pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle of the neck. He has a moderate range of movement and experiences severe pain when attempting to bend his neck forward or backward. There is no visible bruising, swelling, or laceration. The patient also reports fatigue since the accident.

RESULTS:
The patient's X-ray results do not show any fractures. However, due to the patient's severe pain and previous suggestion of a possible fracture by another healthcare provider, the doctor plans to order an MRI for a more thorough examination.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The initial diagnosis is a neck sprain. The doctor plans to treat the condition conservatively, starting with a prescription for Robaxin to help relax the muscles and alleviate pain. The patient is also advised to apply ice to any bruising or swelling, and to perform certain exercises to improve neck movement. If the pain persists, the doctor suggests using a heat pad or topical analgesics like IcyHot or Biofreeze. The patient will also be referred to physical therapy. Depending on the MRI results, local injections may be considered. The patient is given time off work until the MRI results are available and further treatment plans can be made."
