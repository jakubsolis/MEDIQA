D2N088,"Summary:  Andrew, a 59-year-old male with a history of depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, visited his doctor with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection, which he believes started after yard work and not wearing a mask towards the end of summer.  The patient reports fatigue, shortness of breath while doing physical labor, potential fever, joint pain specifically in the elbows and knees, but denies coughing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a history of seasonal allergies. He has had both COVID vaccines. Despite his busy schedule, Andrew has been participating in barre classes to help with relaxation and manage his depression, and has been fairly attentive to his diabetes management and blood pressure monitoring during weekdays.  Upon physical examination, the doctor notes no fevers, normal vital signs, clear lungs with scattered ronchi that improve with cough, and some lower extremity edema. Pain was present upon palpation of the elbows. Chest X-ray results were normal with no signs of pneumonia. However, his Hemoglobin A1c levels were slightly elevated at eight.  The doctor�s assessment is that Andrew has a viral upper respiratory infection, with a low suspicion of COVID-19, but he will still undergo a COVID test to rule it out. The plan includes taking Robitussin for the cough, ibuprofen or Tylenol for fever if needed, and monitoring of symptoms. The doctor is open to starting medication or psychotherapy for depression if Andrew feels necessary in the future. For diabetes, the doctor increases the dosage of metformin and plans to check A1c levels again in four months. Andrew's hypertension seems under control, and the doctor will continue his current dosage of lisinopril and order a lipid panel test. A four-month follow-up appointment is scheduled, and a prescription refill for lisinopril is ordered.  The doctor uses a voice-activated system named ""dragon"" to show medical data and finalize notes during the visit."

D2N090,"The dialogue is between a doctor and a patient named Albert, who is a 62-year-old male with a history of depression, type 2 diabetes, and a kidney transplant. Albert recently visited the emergency room due to feeling woozy, attributed to high blood sugar levels. The cause of the elevated levels was due to eating irregularly and not monitoring his diet while his mother was hospitalized following a hip replacement.  In the consultation, the doctor checks on Albert's management of his diabetes, his kidney transplant status, and his mental health:  1. Albert reports better control of his diet since the ER visit and denies any hospital admission. 2. Albert has been diligent with his immunosuppression medications post-kidney transplant, and his kidney function is stable. 3. Regarding his depression, Albert has been using meditation as a coping strategy and prefers to continue this instead of exploring medication or therapy.  The doctor advises Albert to increase his Lantus dosage to 20 units at night and continue monitoring his blood sugar. The doctor also plans to retest Albert's hemoglobin A1c in a few months to assess his blood sugar control. No medical changes are recommended for his depression or kidney transplant management at this time. The doctor then performs a physical exam, where Albert appears well without distress, but the doctor notes a systolic ejection murmur (which was known in the past) and observes 1+ edema in the lower extremities. Albert's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry, are all within normal limits. Blood sugar levels and other diabetes labs indicate the need for better glycemic control, as his current blood sugar is 162 without having eaten and his recent hemoglobin A1c is 8, indicating his blood sugar levels have been consistently high.  Finally, the doctor instructs his digital assistant, referred to as 'Dragon,' to order a hemoglobin A1c test and to finalize the consultation note. The nurse will subsequently handle Albert's checkout."
D2N091,"Summary:  The patient, Jerry, a 54-year-old male with a history of osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis (MS), came in for his annual exam. He reported having a stressful summer of traveling and adjusting to the fall season. His main complaint was insomnia, which has been affecting him significantly, and he mentioned trying various remedies without success. For his osteoporosis, he has been on Fosamax and reported no joint issues or recent broken bones. He saw his neurologist approximately six months ago for his MS and has been up-to-date with his medication, experiencing no issues and no additional weakness except some lingering issues from knee surgery.  During the physical exam, the doctor noted that Jerry's vital signs were good, his heart and lungs were clear, but he had some lower extremity weakness (right leg 4/5 and left leg 3/5 strength) and arthritic changes in the right knee. The doctor recommended continuing Fosamax for osteoporosis and issued a refill. He advised Jerry to keep seeing his neurologist for the MS and to continue with the prescribed medication.  No other health issues were raised by the patient, and the doctor completed the appointment by finalizing notes with the help of a voice-activated system called Dragon. Jerry did not have any further questions at the end of the visit."

She experienced pain on movement and had previously attempted to use Tylenol, which was ineffective. Upon examination, the doctor found no fractures on her X-ray and suggested that the joint might be injured. The doctor recommended continuing pain relief with 600 mg of ibuprofen three times a day for a week and the use of ice or a heat pad for relief. Mrs. Anderson was advised not to carry heavy weights and to rest her left arm, mentioning a past left arm surgery that the doctor felt was unrelated to the current pain.  The doctor instructed her to return if pain persists after three weeks and to avoid lifting heavy weights with her left arm, encouraging use of her right hand instead. They discussed potentially taking another X-ray on a follow-up visit if there is no improvement. Mrs. Anderson was told she could also try Advil or Aleve for pain management and can contact the doctor or fix an earlier appointment if the pain increases before the advised three-weeks return timeframe.

D2N100,"Summary of Medical Dialogue:  Kayla Ward, a 15-year-old female born on 4/28/07, visited Dr. Juan Price for a new consultation concerning her acne. Her acne began about two years ago, primarily affecting her face. She has been using Persa-Gel and standard facial washing, which provides minimal relief. She reported no other associated symptoms, such as itching, bleeding, or pain, and has no significant past medical history.  Kayla lives with her parents, sister, and several pets. She is in 7th grade, actively participates in sports and uses sunscreen during the summer.  In the consultation, Dr. Price noted that Kayla's acne is limited to her face, and she maintains a simple skincare routine, washing with water in the morning and using a cleanser, toner, and Persa-Gel at night. Dr. Price conducted a full physical examination, excluding areas under underwear and bra. He observed multiple benign nevi, skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face. There was less impact on her chest and back. Based on his assessment, he diagnosed her with mild to moderate acne, mostly comedonal with a small inflammatory component.  Dr. Price recommended a topical therapy routine, including washing with a mild cleanser, using noncomedogenic moisturizer with SPF 30 or higher in the morning, and applying adapalene cream at night, followed by Persa-Gel and noncomedogenic moisturizer. He also advised her to be aware of the increased sun sensitivity and potential dryness or irritation caused by the topical retinoid. Dr. Price scheduled a follow-up in six months to assess progress but encouraged Kayla to reach out before then if needed. Kayla and her mother had no further questions at the end of the appointment."
D2N101,"Summary:  Julia Jones, born on May 16, 1996, consulted with Dr. Gonzalez for a breast reduction. She has been considering the procedure for six to seven years due to ongoing back and neck pain, which she attributes to the size of her breasts. Julia has not had prior consultations for breast reduction. Her current insurance is Blue Cross Blue Shield, but it will change in July due to her husband's new job.  Julia experiences pain at her desk job, has bra strap indentations, and notes discomfort during exercise due to the need to support her breasts. She has seen a chiropractor for pain management and is on migraine medication (propranolol). Julia has a family history of breast cancer; her mother was diagnosed at age 40. She plans to start mammogram screenings when she turns 30.   Dr. Gonzalez finds Julia a good candidate for breast reduction surgery. Julia does not have children and understands there is a 30% chance she may not be able to breastfeed post-surgery. Julia is also informed about the potential for nipple sensation changes, post-operative bruising, and the changes her breasts may undergo with weight fluctuations or pregnancy.   The physical exam revealed asymmetrical, severely ptotic breasts with no signs of discharge, tenderness, masses, or lymphadenopathy. The surgery includes tissue removal, a lift, and nipple elevation to alleviate back and neck pain. The proposed surgery will result in her breasts being reduced to around a small C-cup size. She will likely have a one-night hospital stay post-operation, drains for a week, and scarring typical of this procedure. Activity will be restricted for six weeks post-surgery, with no driving for two to three weeks.  Photographs and documentation of symptoms were taken to submit to Julia's insurance provider once she is on her husband's new insurance plan, to determine medical necessity. The surgical date will be set after insurance approval.  In summary, Julia is proceeding with the recommended steps towards a bilateral reduction mammoplasty to address her symptomatic macromastia, with an expected resection of at least 1,792 grams as estimated by her body surface area and the Schnur scale."

D2N103,"Summary:  Melissa Sanchez, born on 9/23/1962, with MRN 5484367, attended a follow-up office visit post mitral valve repair done on 8/3/2020. Her condition was stable at her last follow-up on 9/17. She has a history of mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, asthma, and recurrent chest discomfort with a negative workup for coronary artery disease. An ECG on 12/26/2020 showed atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response and T-wave inversion anteriorly, with no significant changes from the previous study.  During the visit, Ms. Sanchez reported feeling better post-surgery but still experienced occasional chest pains and shallow breathing a few times a month, lasting just a few minutes. These symptoms resolve when she adjusts her activities accordingly.  Dr. Hughes confirmed Ms. Sanchez has been taking her medications, which include Coumadin, Lasix, and Atenolol. She noted initial irritability with Atenolol, but it has since improved.  The physical exam showed no Jugular Venous Distension (JVD), reduced but clear breath sounds, and an irregularly irregular heartbeat characteristic of atrial fibrillation, which Ms. Sanchez found amusing. She had a slightly accentuated S1 heart sound, no S3, no abdominal pain, no peripheral pain, and trace peripheral edema.  Based on her exam and ECG results, it was determined that Ms. Sanchez's heart valves are functioning well, and her atrial fibrillation is well-controlled with medications. Dr. Hughes advised her to continue her current medications and activity level, recommended a follow-up in six to nine months, and answered her question on when she needs her next check-up.  Ms. Sanchez did not have any more questions and both expressed their pleasure at the visit before parting ways."
D2N104,"Summary of Medical Dialogue:  Patient: Judy Gomez MRN: 869723 DOB: 05/07/1961 Condition: Psoriatic arthritis  The patient, Judy Gomez, visited the office for ongoing management of psoriatic arthritis. She reported generally doing well and is currently on a reduced dose of prednisone (one pill), occasionally taking an extra dose due to pain in her feet, particularly on active days. The doctor discussed the plan to discontinue prednisone completely during this visit and monitored Judy's feedback at her next appointment.  Judy found methotrexate to be helpful for her joint pain. She did not take it the week she received the first dose of her COVID vaccine due to concerns about it interfering with vaccine efficacy. Skipping the methotrexate led to substantial discomfort, which did not improve until she resumed the medication a week later. For the second vaccine dose, Judy took her methotrexate as advised by a hotline, which resulted in less pain post-vaccination.  The doctor confirmed the necessity of monitoring due to the high-risk nature of methotrexate and encouraged Judy to arrange an appointment for blood work. Judy expressed concern about unexplained bruising, which the doctor attributed to the effects of prednisone. The physical examination of Judy's joints and range of motion confirmed an improvement, particularly in her knees, following the increase in methotrexate. The doctor noticed ridges in Judy's nails, a symptom related to her psoriasis.  The doctor's plan includes discontinuing prednisone, continuing methotrexate, and scheduling blood work. The next appointment was set for three months later.   Judy was instructed to arrange her blood work appointment at the front desk before leaving, and the doctor concluded the visit with encouragement about the progress of her treatment."

Assessment and Plan: - Diana has a significant heart murmur likely representative of aortic stenosis. - An echocardiogram is scheduled for today to assess cardiac function, valve view, and potential aortic stenosis. - Based on echocardiogram results, options such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be considered. Surgical replacement (SAVR) is not suitable due to age and medical history. - Her blood pressure is stable, and there are no changes to her medication for blood pressure (amlodipine or lisinopril) and hypothyroidism (levothyroxine). - Frequent PVCs noted on EKG. The echocardiogram will help assess the need for possible ischemic evaluation or heart monitor for PVCs. - The possibility of discontinuing simvastatin for her lipids is pending evaluation by her primary care physician. - Follow-up visit planned for 3-4 weeks after the echocardiogram to discuss results and next steps.  Suggestions: - Keep taking blood pressure and thyroid medications as prescribed. - Discuss potential discontinuation of simvastatin with her primary care physician. - Wait for echocardiogram results before making any decisions on treatment for her heart conditions. - Diana's leg pains and potential aortic stenosis related symptoms require further evaluation and discussion post-echocardiogram results."
D2N106,"Summary:  During the consultation, the patient, Charles, agrees to the doctor using a new recording device for documentation. Charles mentions he has been experiencing shortness of breath and eye watering, which he initially thought were due to allergies. These symptoms have previously led him to visit urgent care, where he was given a nebulizer, and he currently uses an inhaler when symptoms arise. He denies having rashes, nausea, vomiting, lip or throat swelling, and has not had allergies in the past. The symptoms occur in various settings, including at home with and without his cat around, and outside.  Upon examination, the doctor notes that Charles has good vital signs, no rash, no angioedema, and no audible stridor, but does find some faint expiratory wheezing in his lungs. Although Charles had a normal chest X-ray and pulmonary function test, the doctor diagnoses him with newly diagnosed allergic asthma and prescribes a daily dose of Singulair to help reduce asthma occurrences. The doctor also plans to proceed with allergy testing, starting with skin tests, and may consider blood tests and immunotherapy if needed. Charles is scheduled to return the following week to arrange the skin testing. The patient inquires whether he should come with his cats, which the doctor affirms."
D2N107,"Summary:  Bryan visited the doctor's office after experiencing back pain and pins and needles in his right foot that began a few hours after raking leaves. He had similar pain three years prior, which resolved in a day. Bryan tried icing and taking Advil, but it didn't help. He felt some relief from a hot shower and sitting down. The doctor assessed Bryan's back pain through physical examination, noticing pain upon flexion and palpation at the L5 region, but no pain when extending. Bryan mentioned that normally he doesn't engage in physical activities.  The doctor confirmed Bryan's medical records with an X-ray of his lower back which showed normal results. The partner present in the consultation, who is aware of Bryan's high pain tolerance, was concerned and contributed observations, at one point mistakenly mentioning surgery actually referring to Bryan's pain.  The doctor suggested that it could be a sprained back and prescribed Meloxicam and physical therapy to increase Bryan's activity levels and provided stretches and exercises to do at home. If there's no improvement, the doctor mentioned possibly considering an MRI. The partner insisted on getting an MRI right away, showing deep concern for Bryan's condition. However, the doctor recommended waiting two weeks before deciding on further imaging."

Complaints: Ankle pain following a slip on ice two days prior, history of diabetes and high blood pressure.  - Stephanie fell and twisted her left ankle when she slipped on ice, causing immediate soreness, swelling, and difficulty walking. - She has administered self-care with ibuprofen, ice, and elevation, which has provided minor relief. There's significant pain and swelling but no bleeding or pain above the ankle. - Stephanie manages her diabetes with a stable diet, regular blood sugar checks, and metformin medication. Her last hemoglobin A1c was 6.8, reflecting good diabetic control. She is due for a diabetic eye exam, which is already scheduled. - Her blood pressure is well controlled on Norvasc, and she requires a prescription refill.  Doctor's Findings and Actions: - Physical examination of Stephanie revealed tenderness over the lateral malleolus and the fifth metatarsal on the left ankle. There was also pain during valgus stress testing, swelling, and redness but normal sensation and pulses. - No other health concerns were identified during the general physical exam. - The preliminary diagnosis is an ankle sprain, with an X-ray ordered to rule out a fracture. - Stephanie is to be fitted with an air splint, given crutches to avoid weight bearing, prescribed naprosyn for pain, and instructed to continue icing and elevation.  Follow-Up: - If the X-ray indicates a fracture, Stephanie will be referred to orthopedics. If no fracture, she's to progress to partial weightbearing. - The doctor plans to reorder hemoglobin A1c and baseline labs as they have not been checked in a while. - The doctor will refill the Norvasc prescription and advises Stephanie to continue monitoring her blood pressure and to continue diabetic management as is.  The doctor assured Stephanie of a reasonable plan for both her ankle injury and her ongoing health management of diabetes and high blood pressure. Stephanie seemed satisfied with the plan, especially the focus on enabling her to resume exercising."
D2N110,"Summary:  Wayne visited the doctor because of a non-healing sore on his right foot that has been present for about 2-3 weeks. He had previously seen a primary care physician who referred him to this doctor. Wayne mentioned he bought new shoes that were too tight, which led to a blister on his foot, and he has neuropathy which prevented him from initially feeling the discomfort. The sore has not improved, despite completing a course of antibiotics prescribed by his previous doctor, and there's been no pain or other major symptoms like fever or chills, though the wound sometimes sticks to his sock.  The doctor asked about Wayne's diabetes, learning that his last HbA1c reading was a little over 8. The physical examination confirmed the presence of a circular wound on the foot, without signs of infection or necrosis, but with diminished blood supply as evidenced by non-palpable peripheral pulses, although Doppler signals were present.  The doctor's plan includes ordering an ankle-brachial index (ABI) to assess blood supply, debriding the wound, prescribing collagenase ointment, and advising Wayne to wear a surgical shoe to offload pressure. Further antibiotics are deemed unnecessary at the moment, and a follow-up appointment is set for two weeks. The doctor might consider a referral to a vascular specialist if the ABI suggests poor blood supply and plans for a potential diabetes consult to help improve blood sugar control, as this will aid in wound healing.  No additional questions were asked by the patient at the end of the appointment."
D2N111,"**Summary of Medical Dialogue:**  **Chief Complaint:** The patient, William, visited the doctor due to knee pain resulting from a trampoline accident where he heard a snap followed by instant pain.  **Medical History & Symptoms:** - The knee injury occurred one week ago at the patient's first visit to a trampoline park; it was an activity for fun, not regular exercise. - The patient experiences pain on the lateral (outside) aspect of the right knee. - No relief from pain with Tylenol. - Only elevated the knee; no application of ice or heat. - Has been able to bear weight on the knee but with a limp.  **Related Medical History:** - Hypertension: The patient admits to not always remembering to take the prescribed 20 mg of Lisinopril, and has not been regularly monitoring blood pressure or purchased the recommended blood pressure cuff. The doctor notes that the patient's blood pressure is still high (180/80). - Diabetes: The patient checks blood sugar around four to five times a week, and takes prescribed Metformin at 500 mg. Blood sugar levels appear to be somewhat better but not systematically monitored. - Diet: Aims to watch carb intake but has no specific dietary plan or monitoring of specific macros or salt. - Exercise: Inconsistent, nothing regular.  **Physical Examination Findings:** - Regular heart rate and rhythm with no murmur detected. - Clear lungs bilaterally. - Knee examination shows some pain on lateral side, ecchymosis (bruising), and edema (swelling), but no effusion. The patient has a decent range of motion despite pain. - Gait examination reveals a limp.  **Investigations:** - X-ray of the right knee showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.  **Assessment & Plan:** 1. For the knee pain, the doctor suspects a lateral ligament strain. Treatment includes prescribing Meloxicam for pain and swelling, and referral to physical therapy. 2. For hypertension, the doctor decides to continue the current prescription and orders an echocardiogram. There�s consideration for possible medication adjustments. 3. For diabetes, an A1C test and lipid panel will be ordered to get a better understanding of the long-term blood sugar levels and the possibility of medication adjustments.  The doctor provides instructions, and the patient indicates understanding and agreement with the plan."
D2N112,"Summary:  Matthew has been experiencing long-term back pain that has intensified in the past month. The pain is specifically located in the lower back region and radiates down his left leg, which he describes as an electrical toothache. He fell off a roof about 30 years ago, which might have caused a fracture and since then, he has struggled with back issues. His pain worsens with standing, walking, and movements such as coughing and sneezing. Matthew rates his current pain as six out of ten, but it can escalate to thirteen out of ten at its worst. Relief is primarily found when laying down, and both legs feel weak.   Upon physical examination, the doctor found pain upon palpation at the L4 vertebrae and pain with flexion and extension of the back. Matthew exhibits reduced strength in his left leg with 4/5 strength compared to 5/5 on the right. Reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory functions in the lower extremities are intact. An MRI reveals a disc herniation at the L4-L5 level with nerve root impingement.  The doctor's assessment is acute disc herniation at L4-L5 with nerve root impingement, leading to back pain and leg pain. Treatment proposed includes an epidural steroid injection to reduce inflammation at the affected site. This would be followed by physical therapy to strengthen the area. The doctor expects the injection to take full effect in two to three weeks, followed by a check-up in about a month. Matthew agrees to this treatment plan."
D2N113,"Summary:  Patient Jacqueline visited the doctor after being told by her primary care physician that she tested positive for hepatitis C, despite feeling fine. The doctor reviewed her history, which included former IV drug use over fifteen years ago and past heavy alcohol consumption, now limited to about a beer a day with slightly more on weekends. She reported being a current smoker, though down to one to two cigarettes a day. Jacqueline mentioned feeling unusually tired after work, despite her workload not increasing significantly.  Jacqueline has no other medical conditions, but her family history includes hypertension, diabetes, and depression. The physical exam showed no distress or jaundice, with all vitals looking good. Her heart exam revealed a consistent, minor systolic murmur present since the last year, and lung and abdomen exams were normal. She displayed no gait disturbances or edema during the musculoskeletal exam.  The doctor explained that Jacqueline's initial labs were consistent with hepatitis C, and further testing would include a hep C RNA check, HCV genotype, and a special ultrasound to assess liver fibrosis. The doctor advised further testing for Jacqueline's family.  Jacqueline expressed concern for her family's risk, and the doctor recommended they undergo the same screening. She agreed to arrange appointments for them. The doctor concluded the visit by scheduling a follow-up in three weeks and arranging for the nurse to get the additional tests scheduled."
D2N114,"In this medical dialogue, the patient (erroneously labeled as 'doctor') presented with a history of recurrent headaches, which have recently become more frequent and severe. The symptoms included pulsating pain on one side of the head, sometimes behind the eye, and were exacerbated by exercise. Additional troubling symptoms noted by the patient were a ringing in the ears and intermittent blurred vision. The patient has no numbness or tingling in the extremities or face. It was also mentioned that these headaches were initially associated with menstrual periods but have increased in occurrence over time regardless of stress or exercise.  The physician (erroneously labeled as 'patient') conducted a brief review of the patient's exercise habits, particularly footwear preferences and running, before returning to the medical concerns. Upon a physical examination, the physician found normal vitals but noted papilledema�swelling of the optic disc�during the eye examination. No neurological deficits were detected.  Given the patient�s symptoms and examination findings, the physician suspects idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure with unknown etiology, which can potentially lead to vision changes if not treated. To confirm this diagnosis and rule out other causes, the physician plans to arrange an MRI. Following the MRI, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be performed to both assess and possibly relieve the intracranial pressure. Furthermore, the patient is referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam.  The patient expressed concern about the possibility of needing surgery. The physician reassured them that medication and lifestyle changes like regular exercise and weight loss could be effective treatments for IIH. Surgery is not necessarily the first line of treatment.  Before concluding, the patient inquired about the timeline for testing. The physician explained that the MRI would require insurance preapproval, which the office staff would handle, and then they would schedule the MRI.  The conversation ends with the patient still needing to undergo an MRI, a potential spinal tap, and further evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist to confirm the diagnosis and establish a treatment plan."
D2N115,"Summary of Medical Dialogue:  Patient: Jack, experiencing neck pain following a rear-end car accident about a week ago. The pain intensity is rated 7 out of 10 and worsens with movement.  Doctor: Checked the location and nature of the pain, and any other associated symptoms. Jack has limited neck mobility with pain, and there were headaches earlier but not currently. No pain radiation, hearing, or visual problems were reported. No immediate emergency room visit due to cost concerns, and no swelling or bruising was noticed post-accident.  Findings: The physical examination revealed pain on palpation of the neck, pain with neck flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral bending. X-ray results showed no fractures or bony abnormalities.  Diagnosis: Neck strain, likely whiplash from the accident.  Treatment Plan: - Prescribed anti-inflammatories (Motrin, 600 mg every 6-8 hours) and a muscle relaxant (Flexeril, 10 mg every 12 hours as needed). - Advised conservative neck strain management, limiting neck movement to prevent further strain. - An MRI is ordered to rule out a concussion or nerve impingement. - Considering referral to physical rehab or a chiropractor after MRI results are available.

Doctor Response: Addressed the patient's concern, suggesting reputable chiropractors or alternative options like physical therapy.  No further questions from the patient."
D2N116,"Summary:  Bobby visited the doctor due to persistent right shoulder pain, which began after he was doing yard work. The pain had persisted for a few weeks and was notably sore on the outside when raising his arm, though he could move it without restriction. While he has a history of right shoulder pain from a baseball injury when he was younger, this pain felt different. It bothers him during movement and slightly at night, especially since he sleeps on that side. Bobby had been managing the pain with Advil and ice.  Upon examination, the doctor found Bobby's vitals to be normal and there was no numbness in his arm or hand. The examination revealed tenderness at the greater tuberosity of the humerus and a good range of motion and hand grip, with all neurovascular assessments being normal. The shoulder x-ray showed no fracture. The doctor's preliminary diagnosis is rotator cuff tendinopathy. An MRI was recommended due to his prior shoulder issues, along with a referral to physical therapy for 6-8 weeks. Pain management will continue with Tylenol, and a steroid injection may be considered if there is no improvement.  Additionally, Bobby mentioned experiencing soreness in both feet and ankle joints, which his wife attributes to potential dehydration. The doctor suggested trying Epsom salt soaks for relief.  No other injuries were reported, and the doctor and patient agreed to proceed with the proposed treatment plan for the shoulder and foot soreness."
D2N117,"Summary:  Mr. Jackson, a 45-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes and mild intermittent asthma, presented to the doctor with right elbow pain that has been ongoing for about three weeks, which he attributes to increased tennis activity. He ranks the pain as an 8/10 during use and 3/10 at rest, describing it as shooting, stabbing, and very sharp, but localized without radiation. He has tried Tylenol, ibuprofen, and a little ice which provided temporary relief.   Physical examination revealed moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness in the right elbow with pain during passive range of motion, and mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist. The x-ray of the right elbow showed no acute fractures or other bony abnormalities. The diagnosis is acute lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow. The treatment plan includes rest, icing the elbow, wearing a brace, and a prescription for Ultram (Tramadol) for pain. He is advised to avoid tennis for the next four to six weeks. A follow-up visit is scheduled in four weeks.  Regarding his diabetes, his blood sugar levels are a bit high, likely influenced by Easter candy consumption. His metformin dose is increased to 1000 mg twice a day. Additional testing ordered includes hemoglobin A1C, CBC, and chem-12 blood tests. His asthma remains well-controlled, and he will continue on Flovent and Albuterol, with a prescription refill for Albuterol provided.  The doctor emphasized the importance of staying active while managing the elbow pain, and Mr. Jackson acknowledged his need to moderate his activity level due to his age. They engaged in a friendly conversation about sports, which showed a good rapport between the doctor and the patient. The patient accepts the treatment plan and will report back in four weeks or sooner if there are any issues."

D2N119,"The patient, Betty, reports frequent frustrations with her asthma, experiencing coughing and wheezing roughly every month or every other month for the past six months. She identifies getting sick with a cold and exposure to cats as triggers for her asthma flare-ups. She has been repeatedly visiting urgent care or her primary care provider, often getting prescribed steroids like prednisone, and once had a severe episode requiring an emergency department visit. Betty consistently uses a blue albuterol (Ventolin) inhaler, almost daily and sometimes at night when symptoms awaken her.  The doctor gathers detailed information about Betty's medication usage, asthma triggers, and lifestyle, including smoking and vaping habits (of which she has none), and exposure to environmental irritants like smoke in bars. On examination, the doctor confirms her vitals are stable and discovers bilateral expiratory wheezes and diminished lung sounds. Pulmonary function test results are consistent with asthma.  The doctor diagnoses Betty with moderate intermittent asthma and emphasizes the importance of using an inhaled steroid inhaler consistently to improve daily symptoms and reduce the need for the albuterol inhaler. The doctor prescribes Flovent (fluticasone propionate) 110 micrograms, one puff twice daily, and reinforces the use of albuterol as needed. An asthma action plan will be provided, detailing how to manage symptoms and triggers. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for one month later or sooner if symptoms worsen."
D2N120,"Summary:  Larry, the patient, sought consultation with the doctor due to a persistent back pain he�s experienced for a couple of years, which began after moving furniture one weekend. The pain is described as a sharp, stabbing sensation that sometimes radiates down his right leg to his big toe, accompanied by numbness, tingling, but no weakness, loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area, or loss of bladder or bowel control. Larry has tried physical therapy and strong pain medications but is hesitant about surgery. His pain has affected his daily life and hobbies, like golf, and has contributed to weight gain.  Upon examination, the doctor finds tenderness at the L4-L5 disk space and right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness, with pain during lumbar flexion and decreased sensation to light touch on Larry's right lateral thigh. Reflexes are symmetrical. Larry's MRI indicates a herniated disk with nerve impingement at L4-L5, leading to radiculopathy.  The doctor suggests a treatment plan including a spinal injection of corticosteroids under fluoroscopy to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. The frequency of injections will be determined by Larry�s response but will not exceed four times a year. The procedure is quick and can be done within the same day. Larry agrees to begin treatment and the doctor prepares to administer the first injection or schedule it at Larry's convenience."
D2N121,"Summary of the medical dialogue:  The patient visited the doctor due to right knee pain that began five days prior after a waterskiing accident on Lake Martin, where he twisted his knee on landing. The patient described a stretching sensation and subsequent swelling but did not hear a pop. They were able to exit the water by themselves despite the soreness and swelling, but found squatting and bending to be painful. This was the first injury to the patient's knee.  During the consultation, the doctor confirmed that the patient's blood pressure is well-managed with lisinopril, with no side effects reported and home readings averaging 125/80 mmHg. The patient showed no signs of lymphadenopathy, had regular heart rhythm without murmurs, clear lungs, and was maintaining good blood pressure at 120/77 mmHg in the office.  Upon clinical examination, the doctor noted ecchymosis, edema, and an effusion in the right knee, with pain on palpation and a decreased range of motion. There were no positive signs of ligament tears, and pulses were palpable in the foot.  The doctor diagnosed the patient with a medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain and recommended ordering an x-ray to rule out fractures, prescribing physical therapy and meloxicam 15 mg daily for inflammation and pain control. The patient was advised against skiing the following day to prevent further injury and to rest until x-ray results were available.  Regarding the patient's hypertension, the doctor decided to continue the current lisinopril treatment and ordered a lipid panel for additional examination. The doctor also noted the patient was due for a tetanus shot, which was advised for health maintenance.  Overall, the patient was receptive to the plan and had no further questions.

D2N127,"Summary of Medical Dialogue:  Patient: Brandon Complaint: Severe neck pain  History: - Multiple car crashes; the most recent one occurred in February of the current year.  - Previous therapy and surgery after the third crash. - Pain clinic visit due to ongoing neck and back pain. - Previously prescribed fentanyl, but no current prescription.  Symptoms: - Neck pain rated at 12 on a scale of 1-10.  - Sharp, incapacitating pain, inhibiting the ability to work. - Headaches, occasional dizziness, numbness in the left arm and right leg, muscle spasms, fatigue post-accident. - Reduced range of motion in neck, hurts to bend neck forward and backward. - Occasional bruising without current signs of visible injury.  Assessment: - Physical examination reveals pain on palpation on the bony process and muscles around the neck. Moderate range of neck movement. - X-ray results showed no fractures; a good sign considering the number of car accidents. - Suggested diagnosis of neck sprain.  Plan: - Refer to MRI for a more thorough examination to rule out Pamela's suspicion of a possible fracture and to satisfy legal requirements. - Prescribe Robaxin (15mg, every 6-8 hours) to relax muscles and relieve tension. - Provide a list of neck exercises for the patient to perform every morning. - Offer alternatives to fentanyl like heat pad, IcyHot/BioFreeze, and potential for local injections after evaluating MRI results. - Referral to physical therapy is considered. - Suggested time off work until MRI results clarify the condition and inform the potential interventions for targeted pain relief.  Patient's Relationship with Medical Staff: - The patient compared their interaction with the doctor to that with another professional, Pamela, and expressed a preference for Pamela. However, a referral did not seem to be an option as the lawyer advised visiting this specific doctor.  The patient appeared to be in extreme distress, emphasizing the severity of the pain experienced, which impacts his occupational capacity. The doctor made efforts to manage the patient's pain conservatively while arranging further diagnostic processes to understand the extent of the injury better. The doctor also empathized with the patient's discomfort and tried to ensure a careful, tailored response to the patient�s complex medical situation."
